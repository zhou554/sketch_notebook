# UI Design Brain

A Cursor skill that gives the AI agent real UI component knowledge — best practices, layout patterns, and design-system conventions for 60+ interface components — so it generates production-grade UI instead of generic output.

## What it does

When you ask Cursor to build a UI, it typically guesses at component patterns. This skill replaces guessing with a curated knowledge base sourced from [component.gallery](https://component.gallery) and enriched with:

- **Best practices** for every component (accessibility, sizing, behavior)
- **Common layouts** — proven arrangements for each pattern
- **Aliases** — so the agent recognizes components by any name
- **Design philosophy** — modern, minimal, SaaS-quality standards
- **Anti-patterns** — specific things to avoid

The result: interfaces that feel designed by a senior product designer, not assembled from a template.

## Install

### Option A — Personal skill (all projects)

```bash
# Clone into your Cursor skills directory
git clone https://github.com/carmahhawwari/ui-design-brain.git \
  ~/.cursor/skills/ui-design-brain
```

### Option B — Project skill (shared with team)

```bash
# Clone into your project's .cursor/skills directory
git clone https://github.com/carmahhawwari/ui-design-brain.git \
  .cursor/skills/ui-design-brain
```

### Option C — Manual

Copy the `SKILL.md` and `components.md` files into either:
- `~/.cursor/skills/ui-design-brain/` (personal)
- `.cursor/skills/ui-design-brain/` (project)

## Usage

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you ask Cursor to build UI. You don't need to reference it explicitly.

### Examples

Just ask naturally:

```
Build a settings page with a sidebar navigation, toggle preferences, and a profile section.
```

```
Create a data table with search, filters, sortable columns, and pagination.
```

```
Design a SaaS dashboard with KPI cards, a chart area, and an activity feed sidebar.
```

The agent will automatically:
1. Identify which components your request needs
2. Look up best practices for each one
3. Apply the right design direction (SaaS, minimal, corporate, creative, or dashboard)
4. Generate production-ready code following the patterns

### Design directions

The skill includes 5 built-in style presets. You can request one explicitly:

| Preset | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Modern SaaS** | Default — clean, spacious, professional |
| **Apple-level Minimal** | Ultra-clean with generous whitespace |
| **Enterprise / Corporate** | Information-dense, keyboard-navigable |
| **Creative / Portfolio** | Bold, expressive, editorial typography |
| **Data Dashboard** | Optimized for data scannability |

```
Build a pricing page with an Apple-minimal aesthetic.
```

## How it differs from frontend-design skills

| | Generic frontend skill | UI Design Brain |
|-|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Component knowledge** | None — relies on model training | 60 components with specific best practices |
| **Layout guidance** | General advice | Concrete layout patterns per component |
| **Anti-patterns** | Not addressed | Explicit list of things to avoid |
| **Accessibility** | Mentioned loosely | Specific per-component rules (focus trapping, ARIA, keyboard nav) |
| **Design system grounding** | Model's general knowledge | Sourced from real design systems via component.gallery |

## Contributing

PRs welcome. To add or update components:

1. Edit `components.md` — follow the existing format (name, aliases, description, best practices, common layouts)
2. If the component is commonly needed, add it to the quick reference table in `SKILL.md`
3. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines
